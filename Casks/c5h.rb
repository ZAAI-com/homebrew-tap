# Homebrew Cask template for C5h.
# Rendered by Toolkit/Homebrew/render-cask.sh into Casks/c5h.rb on the tap.
#
# C5h ships as a single universal (signed + notarized + stapled) .app inside a
# DMG, so there is one artifact and one SHA256 (no arch split). The zap stanza
# removes the app's data directory (see the c5h_data_locations note).
