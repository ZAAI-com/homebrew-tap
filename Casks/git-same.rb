# inside user-managed workspace roots that the cask cannot safely enumerate.

  # Installs the background monitor as a separate helper in the user's
  # Library and starts it when monitoring is enabled. The helper does not
  # depend on the app bundle, so closing or moving Git-Same.app never stops
  # monitoring. `installer script:` runs outside the cask sandbox (it has to
  # reach launchd) and EXECUTES BEFORE `app` moves the bundle, even though
  # `brew style` requires it to be written after `app`. That is why the
  # executable is the staged copy and the final app path is passed in.
  # The installer retains a copy of itself next to the staged bundle; the
  # uninstall stanza runs that copy, so removal still works after the app or
  # the helper was deleted. Requires packaging protocol 1
  # (`git-same monitor --agent-protocol-version`), which S3 verifies.
