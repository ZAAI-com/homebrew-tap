# The zap stanza intentionally only removes the well-known user config and cache
# directories. Per-workspace .git-same/ caches are NOT zapped because they live
# inside user-managed workspace roots that the cask cannot safely enumerate.

  app "Git-Same.app"
  # Installs the background monitor LaunchAgent but does not start it: the
  # program it names is not on disk yet (see below), and launchd parks a job
  # whose program is missing at load (EX_CONFIG) and never retries it. Unless
  # the user stopped monitoring (a Stop survives upgrades), the monitor starts
  # when Homebrew reopens the app after an upgrade, when the user next opens
  # Git-Same, or at the next login. The agent execs the app
  # bundle's own main executable in
  # headless `monitor` mode, not the CLI helper: macOS TCC attributes a
  # launchd-spawned process to its bundle only when the executable is the
  # bundle's CFBundleExecutable, so this is what lets one Full Disk Access
  # grant for "Git-Same" cover the monitor. Closing the app does not stop
  # monitoring; moving or deleting the bundle does, which the app reports.
  # `installer script:` runs outside the cask sandbox (it has to
  # reach launchd) and EXECUTES BEFORE `app` moves the bundle, even though
  # `brew style` requires it to be written after `app`. That is why the
  # executable is the staged copy and the final app path is passed in.
  # The installer retains a copy of itself next to the staged bundle; the
  # uninstall stanza runs that copy, so removal still works after the app or
  # the helper was deleted. Requires packaging protocol 1
  # (`git-same monitor --agent-protocol-version`), which S3 verifies.
